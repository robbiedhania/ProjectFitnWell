## About-
Started Working On The Project With My Team On The Idea Of Making A Website On A Hotel, Which Would Provide A Look On The Hotel's Services And Speacialities. We Divided The Work In Different Sections And Each Individual Was Working On A Specific Page And Also Including A Few Links From Other Pages Too. I Was Given The Task To Work On The Wellness And Fitness Section Of The Hotel Plus Had To Talk About The Event And The Food Section Too. I Worked On Learning And Enhancing My HTML And CSS Skills Using Lot Of Styles And All The Syntaxs And Semantics To Make My Webpages Look Very Nice, Eye Catching And Responsive.

## Learning Curve And Challanges
It Was A Very Good Learning Experience And Certinly Very Beffitting As Well, Being Able To Create A Webpage Seemed Like A Huge Achievement Considering I Come Form A Non IT Background, It Was Very Nerve Wrecking Initially And I Felt Disappointed When Things Didnt Work Too Well But Graddually Things Fell In Place And I Started To Learn New Thnings In Class And Learning Online Too. Its Still A Very Long Way To Go But I Am Positive I Will Be Able To Make My Webpage Look As Its Expected And Yes Continue To Learn More Skills And Get To LEarning Java Script Usage Too Over The Time.

## Resources
Used A Lot Of Refrences From The Class Using The RecordingS From Blackboard And Also Took Help From Youtube And Linkedin Learning To Create This Webpage.
